# Emojichat ðŸ˜‹ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘‹

This application demonstrates the use Firebase Realtime Database to create a simple chatting appliation, while a Firebase cloud function runs in the background that converts text to emojis

## Install UI
Assuming you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, run the command in the emojichat folder

```
npm install
```
This app is written in Ionic, so you will need to install the [Ionic CLI](https://ionicframework.com/getting-started)
```
npm install -g ionic
```

## Install Cloud Functions
Run command in the `emojichat/functions` folder.
```
npm install
```


## Getting Started
1. Create a Firebase app from the [Firebase Console](console.firebase.google.com)

2. You will need to modify the `app.module.ts` to change the firebase configuration from your firebase console. Take a look at the [setup guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup)
```
export const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "xxxxxxxxxx",
  authDomain: "your-domain-name.firebaseapp.com",
  databaseURL: "https://your-domain-name.firebaseio.com",
  storageBucket: "your-domain-name.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: '<your-messaging-sender-id>'
};
```
3. Start the application by running
```
ionic serve
```
4. Since this demo app doesnt handle authentication, we will need to disable authentication from the Firebase console. After selecting Database, select the Rules tab, and modify the rules
```
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": "auth == null",
    ".write": "auth == null"
  }
}
```
**Note! this is not recommended to leave the rules unsecured. Please restore the rules after you have done testing.**

5. You will need to deploy the functions for the Emoji translation to work.

## Deploy
1. Modify the `.firebaserc` file and replace it with your Firebase project id.

3. In the `emojichat` folder, run the command below. This will deploy the app on Firebase Hosting, and Firebase Cloud function.
```
firebase deploy
```
